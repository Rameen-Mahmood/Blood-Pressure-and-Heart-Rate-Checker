# Blood-Pressure-and-Heart-Rate-Checker
This software uses pressure readings in order to calculate one's systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as your heart rate. It eliminates the need for one to go to the hospital to measure your blood pressure, as it consistently gives feedback on your release rate of the pressure valve, upper and lower bounds of pressure to pump, etc.
